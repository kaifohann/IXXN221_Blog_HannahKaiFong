            <h1>Week 1</h1>
            <p>
                Going into this course, I'm very excited to learn how HTML and CSS work. I've had previous experience using other coding languages, but none in connection with website building. I'm expecting it to be harder than it looks, but I'm ready for the challenge. I'm intrigued by the idea of a CMS, but I'm not familiar with how it works or the skills needed to use it. Hopefully, I'll gain a better understanding of these throughout the course as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at the upcoming assignments, I'm particularly surprised by assignment 1 and its focus on a fictional persona. Based on the previous IXXN papers I've taken, I was expecting to spend more time/assignments dedicated to learning about the intended user via interviewing and process walk-throughs with potential users. I guess this has been compressed so we can focus more on the website-building aspect of the course. I'm actually really happy about this. Even though I know that the research side of interaction design is incredibly important, it's probably my least favourite part of the process. I tend to enjoy getting straight into developing the actual product.

            <h1>Week 2</h1>
            <p>
                I found the history part of this week's lecture interesting. I'm always impressed by how far the internet/website design has come in such a short amount of time. This becomes particularly apparent when looking at early versions of Apple and Google pages, which have such 'clean' aesthetics now, but were incredibly messy when they first premiered. The typography used on their early websites is particularly jarring to me, with the fonts, sizing, and weights all at odds with one another. I suppose this just speaks to how much typography contributes to a website's branding and overall feel. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We were also introduced to user personas this week. I think the biggest challenge with these is creating a persona that reflects the personality, goals, and barriers of an entire group. By default I would probably pick a single person and base the persona on them, however, the persona is only helpful if it encompasses the group, not the individual. This will be a challenge for me when creating a persona for assignment one, and I'm predicting that it will involve a fair bit of research into whatever demographic I pick. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the first tutorial video on coding, I found it pretty straightforward. In MDDN201 we've just been introduced to HTML5UP templates, so the concept of working from top to bottom in a file corresponding to the top and bottom of a website isn't a surprise. Some of the tags e.g. h1 and h3, are new to me, and I'm intrigued by how many of these tags exist that I don't know of yet. At the moment I'm finding it difficult to remember what each of the tags represents but I think through practice, this will become easier. I'm pretty confused about how these linear sections eventually turn into the complex layouts we see on websites daily, but I'm assuming that we'll learn about this throughout the course.

            <h1>Week 3</h1>
            <p>
                We were introduced to the goal Venn diagrams this week. These look at the designer goals vs user goals and the shared goals that can be drawn from them. I really like Venn diagrams and I'm surprised this is the first I've seen of them in interaction design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found that I appreciate having visual representations of thought processes like this. My past experience with interaction design has meant that finding the shared goal has often been a bit abstract and explored through written explanation, but I find it more digestible and logical to make diagrams like these instead. They're simple but efficient, which I can appreciate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The coding lecture this week was pretty straightforward as well.  I like how efficient HTML is when used correctly. I like that the files work in chronological order and that the tags are simply shortcuts for formatting - I've found the whole system to be surprisingly satisfying. I'm still a bit confused as to how these linear layouts turn into the more complex layouts we see on websites usually, but I'm sure that's to come.

            <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <p>
                We started looking at the CSS box model this week and general CSS styling. It is starting to make sense how more complex websites can be created using HTML. Similar to how I found HTML tags a few weeks ago, the number of CSS properties that are available is overwhelming to me and I'm going to have to practice a lot more with CSS to remember what each property does.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the lecture this week, I found the topics of flat design and material design particularly interesting. I remember noticing a switch around 2010-2014 to the material/flat design aesthetic, and I also remember finding these websites more aesthetically pleasing and easier to use. Retrospectively it's probably one of the earliest moments that I can remember the aesthetic-usability effect affecting me. Looking at my default web design style now, I can see how much influence these 2 styles have had on my design instincts over the years, as their 'look' is something I automatically gravitate towards.

                We're prepping to hand in assignment 1 this week. I'm pretty happy with my current progress. I had no idea that Figma offered so many templates to use for user personas/customer journey maps etc. These have been helpful, as often designing these from scratch is what ends up taking most of my time, and my content suffers in quality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We were introduced to CSS grids this week. Again - the complexity of current websites is starting to make a lot more sense. I find the grid concept to be quite difficult to wrap my head around in terms of the number of properties involved and what they 'accept'. I have found that researching each CSS property has been beneficial as I can gain a better understanding of its purpose and limitations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also found that debugging in CSS can be quite difficult, especially if I've missed something very small. I have learned to stop and check code in smaller sections to avoid this happening so often.

            <h1>Week 6</h1>
            <p>
                We covered typography and colour in this week's lecture. 
The rem and em font-size value is a new concept to me but makes a lot of sense, as I've always wondered why we tend to work in px for type but not images. I can see this being particularly beneficial when translating websites onto phone screen sizes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm glad we covered leading in this lecture as it's often something that I forget about. Looking at the examples in the lecture, I'm reminded of what a massive difference it can make when it comes to readability. I'll keep this in mind for the upcoming assignment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I like the simplicity of the 60-30-10 rule when it comes to colour. I think I have always applied this method in my previous design work but never put it into words. For the upcoming assignment, I will try to apply this rule to maintain a simple but effective colour story throughout the website. As for the actual colours I'll pick, I will probably revisit Coolors as suggested in class. I've used this tool for previous projects and find it incredibly helpful for picking an effective palette. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm reasonably familiar with using GitHub so there weren't too many surprises in the coding lecture. However, the use/purpose of branches in GitHub has never been introduced to me. I like this aspect of GitHub and can see how this would be advantageous when working with other people. Although I won't be using it in the upcoming assignment, I'll keep it in mind if I'm assigned any group work in the future.

            <p>
                Because I'm new to web design, composition is something I struggle with a lot. It's not something that I instinctively take note of when opening a website, but I'm certainly starting to because of this course. I don't find visual hierarchy to be too challenging as we cover it a lot in communication design papers, however, grid composition is a challenge. At the moment I understand grids when looking at them but I struggle to translate them into code ie. separating elements into divs, margins, etc. I'm hoping this will improve with practice and improve with the CSS grids part 2 video.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this week's lecture, another thing I've found that I take for granted is affordances. The general design of these is not something that I think about a lot and I only notice them when they're done poorly. Affordances are something that I will have to focus a lot on for assignment 2.1, as my website will involve a lot of input fields, buttons, icons, and links. Having their functions obvious is vital for the user experience on my website, so I will have to pay particularly close attention to their design and consistency across the pages.

            <p>
                I did pretty poorly on time management for assignment 2.1. Unfortunately, the assignment came around at one of the busiest parts of my trimester, which meant I didn't get to spend as much time on it as I'd have liked. I'm not completely disappointed with what I've turned in. I like the general layouts, colour palette, and visual language of the website, but I didn't get to do a sweep over for consistency, button variation, and animations. I think this will come back to bite me when formatting my actual website in the next assignment. I also don't have a great understanding of grids at the moment, and that shows in my design. Again, this is going to make it harder for me in the next assignment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the presentation, it went okay. I got the feedback that I was expecting. Mainly the obvious flaws with consistency and sizing which I'll aim to improve in 2.2. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We were also introduced to the assignment 2.2 brief. I'm leaning towards using a CMS for this assignment as I assume it will be easier to use. Although I have a decent understanding of coding from scratch, I think I'd struggle to recreate what I've designed in 2.1 straight from code. I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling that a CMS may be easier to use. As it's quite a short time before hand-in I think it would be beneficial to choose the quicker route and leave the longer coding process for my blog submission. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The CSS grids part 2 video has definitely grown my understanding of formatting pages. However, I do find the coding process for this quite confusing. I've been finding it helpful to inspect random web pages to see how their grid works and what the hierarchy of divs is within the grid. Again, I think my issue with this concept is just a lack of practice and exposure to working code. I'll be working to improve this over the upcoming weeks - especially in order to complete my coded-from-scratch blog.

                I found the responsive aspect of HTML/CSS the hardest part to wrap my head around. I sort of assumed going into website building that responsiveness was all automatic and elements would fit nicely into a resized screen. Unfortunately, I was wrong and this has made assignment 2.2 a lot harder for me. As I've begun looking at how to use Webflow for Assignment 2.2, the responsiveness is what I'm having the most difficulty recreating. I've also never reflected on how websites respond when resizing the screen so I don't even know how it should look when it happens. The introduction of rem and em has been beneficial to this learning process, but I do find it difficult to mix these units with set values, percentages, and vw/vh.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to use Webflow for assignment 2.2 after talking to Psychoactive Studios during careers week. They indicated that Webflow was their website-building tool of choice and that it would be beneficial to learn. I think it's important to at least learn the basics of industry-standard tools, so I thought I would give it a go.
            </p>
            <p>
                My general introduction to Webflow has not been as smooth as I'd hoped. Unfortunately, I think I'm going to regret using a CMS even though I had predicted it would be easier than coding from scratch. The general layout of the Webflow space is quite confusing to me and it's hard to keep track of the classes you make across pages. I've had to rely a lot on Webflow University and even then I'm struggling to make things work. I've been surprisingly better at time management in this assignment ie. I started when I should have, but the learning curve is more challenging than I'd hoped and it's eating away at a lot of my time. In retrospect, I either should have chosen to code this assignment from scratch, or introduced myself to Webflow earlier in the trimester to get a headstart.

                I'm slowly getting better at using Webflow. I'm still struggling a bit with the responsiveness of the website, but I've gained a better understanding of how the box model and classes work. I'm pretty satisfied with how much I've learned and I'm happy that I didn't panic and switch to coding last week. I'm still of the mind that this assignment would have been easier if I had chosen to code from scratch, but I'm feeling more confident in my ability to get this project done now. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm glad we got a blog demo this week. I haven't started coding yet, but I have set up my GitHub repo. I was feeling pretty intimidated by the last assignment, but after looking at the examples, I think I should be able to recreate something similar. I'm grateful for my progress in the 2.2 assignment because even though I am using a CMS, my understanding of the box model has improved a lot and I'm confident it will help me create something with aesthetic appeal for assignment 3.

                We did our final presentation this week. Not my best presentation to be honest. Even though the session was casual, I didn't have a proper structure of what elements of my design I wanted to highlight. I'm going to attribute this to the almost all-nighter the project ended up creating, but presenting is definitely a skill I want to improve on in next year's web design paper. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We were asked 'How do you feel about coding after all the coding lectures?' for this week's reflection. 
This course has solidified for me that it was the correct decision to move from computer science to design. I took computer science at UC for two years before deciding that the degree wasn't fulfilling enough for me. Even though I quite enjoyed the coding aspect of the course, I didn't enjoy the more mathsy aspects and the lack of creativity. Moving to design, I worried that the coding skills I had gained in my first two years of uni had gone to waste. Through taking this course, I think I can safely say that they haven't. Even though I had never touched HTML/CSS before, I still feel that learning these languages was much easier due to my previous coding knowledge. AND - I actually got to create something appealing with the code, not just a spreadsheet - YAY! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've still got a lot to learn when it comes to the intricacies of HTML and CSS but I'm grateful that my previous coding experience and knowledge of programming made the transition into this language a lot easier. So, to answer the actual question - I enjoy coding now more than I ever have, and I'm very excited to see what else it can do for me in my design work :).

                My final task in this course was finishing up this blog. Although a bit random, the illustrations were a good way of making this project more fun for me. I think they added a point of difference and were a simple method of increasing the website's visual appeal. After planning what I wanted this blog to look like, I found tutorials that created a similar look. My main point of reference was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IsC4PLXv9w. I went through this whole coding walk-through and found a lot of design ideas that I felt expanded on my original plan. From this tutorial, I ended up adding the banner design and the image animations as I felt they tied the website together nicely. As I wanted to learn how to create overlay popouts, I also referred to this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE_6pQ3RlZU, and then formatted these to better fit in with the rest of the website. I'm really proud of the finished project and I think it reflects my preferred style as a designer quite well.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I am satisfied that the gap between 'my plan' and the finished outcome seems to be shrinking as I practice more with the box method and explore different CSS properties. Surprisingly, I found that it was easier to bring my blog idea to life with coding than it was to bring my previous assignment to life using Webflow. I would chalk this up to the number of HTML tutorials online and their simple naming schemes. Although I feel that Webflow University's videos are great, my limited knowledge of CSS property names and website anatomy in general made the learning process a lot harder. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I enjoyed this course and I feel that it has been the paper that I have developed the most as a designer in this trimester. I'm particularly happy with how much I feel my skills have developed in terms of being able to use HTML, CSS, and Webflow. I liked how this course was structured, however, I think it would be beneficial to have a longer period to develop our CMS/coded final websites. In retrospect, I would happily have sacrificed some of the time it took to do the Figma project so that I could have more time to familiarise myself with Webflow. 
In terms of the actual content of the course, I think it was very helpful to have the short coding tutorials every week. I found this format easily digestible and particularly convenient when I needed to relearn a specific skill when completing my assignments.
